# Stats check ðŸ”¢

Cloudflare worker function to update github bio automatically with leetcode and codeforces profile stats ðŸš€

## How it works

I run a CRON Job âŒš every 30 minutes and update my github bio with my current codeforces rating and leetcode stats.

You can also use it by adding your own config file ðŸ”§ with the following information:

1. Github PAT token with permissions for modifying user data.
2. Codeforces username.
3. Leetcode username.
